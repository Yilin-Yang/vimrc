Yilin Yang's Personal `.vimrc`
================================================================================
A public repository containing my [(neo)](https://neovim.io/)vim configuration,
as well as the shell scripts that I use to install it onto new machines.

I'm not necessarily providing this so that people can just use it "as-is", since
doing that would deprive them of the joy of getting their vim install to
work exactly how *they* like it. (It would also just make their config harder to
debug, since they wouldn't be familiar with where everything is.) It's meant
mostly as a reference, in case I'm helping a classmate configure vim and need
something to point at as I explain something.

An (Incomplete) List of (Hyperlinks to) Plugins That I Use
